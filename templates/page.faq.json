            "question": "WHAT IS RATTAN?",
            "answer": "<p>Rattan is a natural climbing vine prized for its strength, density, and flexibility. Unlike hollow bamboo, rattan has a solid core, making it exceptionally durable for furniture. Wicker refers to the weaving technique, not the material, so our Belgian Pearls pieces are rattan woven in wicker patterns.</p>"

            "question": "HOW DO I CARE FOR RATTAN FURNITURE?",
            "answer": "<p>Rattan is durable but naturally porous. We recommend placing furniture in covered outdoor spaces to protect from direct rain and prolonged sun exposure. However, over time, rattan develops a natural patina, which enhances its character. Dust with a soft cloth and wipe gently with a damp cloth as needed. Avoid harsh chemicals. </p>"

            "answer": "<p>Each piece is finished in natural tones that highlight rattan’s organic character. Variations occur because rattan is a natural material—it develops a warm patina with age and use. Belgian Pearls offers refined shades ranging from soft honey to deep espresso. Exact tones may vary slightly, ensuring every piece is one of a kind.</p>"
